Aloha, web surfer. So perhaps you're a `let` enthusiast who came here to see what was up. Or maybe you're a beginner, just moving out of `var` world and into the wild west that is ES6 variable declaration. Whatever your experience level may be, I hope this article provides valuable insights and leaves you with a solid rule of thumb for instantiating variables in Javascript. <!--Also, I think it's worth mentioning that throughout this article I will be using "Javascript" in lieu of the more specific "ES6" because in June 2017, I'd like to believe that the language features introduced in ES6 can now be thought of as just part of Javascript rather than some "other" language.--> My other hope is that upon finishing this article, you don't even *think* about `var` anymore. 

### Once Upon A Time...
...in a specification authored somewhere in California...

...there was a keyword for variable instantiation named `var`. 

If you remember your first day of learning Javascript, it probably involved `var`. This little keyword, short for `variety` (joke), took us a long way. In fact, every web site and application that used Javascript between it's inception in 1995 and the release of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) used `var` and only `var` to create variables. 

The `var` keyword is no longer relevant, but in order to truly understand our present, we must understand our past.

Some important things to know about the `var` keyword: 
```
1) It is function scoped
2) It gets hoisted
```

### How Times Have Changed

### Let me explain...

### Const you see the benefits?

### When & why?

### Use const until you have to use let
