Nearly a year ago, I listened to a podcast that mentioned a front-end technology called Elm. I did some digging and thought it was cool, so I joined the Elm DC meetup group. I noticed there were no meetups scheduled for Elm DC and there hadn't been for some time, but I didn't take much note of it. I was busy getting adjusted to a move across the country and a new job. 

A few weeks passed and a curious email popped up in my inbox. The organizer for Elm DC was having another child and didn't have time to run the meetup any longer (he also runs 4 or 5 other tech meetups in the DC area so it's understandable) -- he was looking for someone to take over. I let the email sit for a day while I thought about it. I doubted I had the hutzpah (organizational skills crossed with confidence) to organize a meetup myself, but something was telling me to do it. So I did. 

Within a week, I had met up with the organizer to get the rundown of what steps to take to ensure a successful meetup, received ownership of the meetup on meetup.com, spoke to my employer about sponsoring / hosting the meetup in our office, and set up the first event. The ball was rolling. 

I went into the first Elm DC meetup, of which I was the organizer, with zero knowledge of Elm. I knew it was a programming language designed with the functional reactive paradigm in mind, and that it inspired Redux, but that's it. We are using Angular (4) with RxJS and ngrx/store at work so I understood some of the concepts at a high level, but I couldn't have told you how to write a function in Elm. 

As it turned out, I was not the only one there lacking Elm experience. Of the five other folks who showed up, only one had even dipped their toe in the Elm waters. I was relieved. For the first couple of meetups, we mostly just talked about the history of functional programming for a couple of hours and everyone went home. Meetup adjourned.

As the months passed, I got used to scheduling the meetups, speaking to the group, giving lightning talks, arranging lightning talks, and generally getting the conversation going.
