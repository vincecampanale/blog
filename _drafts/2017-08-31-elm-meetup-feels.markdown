Nearly a year ago, I listened to a podcast that mentioned a front-end technology called Elm. I did some digging and thought it was cool, so I joined the Elm DC meetup group. I noticed there were no meetups scheduled for Elm DC and there hadn't been for some time, but I didn't take much note of it. I was busy getting adjusted to life in the "real-world" (post college) and my new job. 

A few weeks passed and a curious email popped up in my inbox. The organizer for Elm DC was having another child and decided that he didn't have time to run the meetup any longer (he also runs 4 or 5 other tech meetups in the DC area so it's understandable) -- he was looking for someone to take over. I let the email sit for a day while I thought about it. I doubted I had the hutzpah (read: organizational skills crossed with confidence) to organize a meetup myself, but something deeper was telling me to do it. So I did. 

Within a week, I had met up with the organizer to get the rundown of what steps to take to ensure a successful meetup, received ownership of the meetup on meetup.com, spoke to my employer about sponsoring / hosting the meetup in our office, and set up the first event. The ball was rolling. 

I went into the first Elm DC meetup, of which I was the organizer, with zero knowledge of Elm. I knew it was a programming language designed with the functional reactive paradigm in mind, and that it inspired Redux. We are using Angular (4) with RxJS and ngrx/store at work so I understood the concepts at a high level, but I couldn't have told you how to write a function in Elm. 

Luckily, I was not the only one there lacking Elm experience. Of the five other folks who showed up, only one had even dipped their toe in the Elm waters. We learned some together, but mostly just talked about the history of functional programming for a couple of hours and everyone went home. Meetup adjourned.

As the months passed, I got used to arranging the meetups and got more comfortable with speaking to the group, giving lightning talks, arranging lightning talks with the members, and generally getting the conversation centered on Elm. 

At the most recent meetup, I had the idea to hook my Macbook up to the big TV in the conference room and work through a coding challenge in Elm.
