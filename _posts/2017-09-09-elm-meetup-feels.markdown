Nearly a year ago, I listened to a podcast that mentioned a front-end technology called Elm. I did some digging and thought it was cool, so I joined the Elm DC meetup group. I noticed there were no meetups scheduled for Elm DC and there hadn't been for some time, but I didn't take much note of it. I was busy getting adjusted to a move across the country and a new job. 

A few weeks passed and a curious email popped up in my inbox. The organizer for Elm DC was having another child and didn't have time to run the meetup any longer (he also runs 4 or 5 other tech meetups in the DC area so it's understandable) -- he was looking for someone to take over. I let the email sit for a day while I thought about it. I doubted I had the hutzpah (organizational skills crossed with confidence) to organize a meetup myself, but something was telling me to do it. So I did. 

Within a week, I had met up with the organizer to get the rundown of what steps to take to ensure a successful meetup, received ownership of the meetup on meetup.com, spoke to my employer about sponsoring / hosting the meetup in our office, and set up the first event. The ball was rolling. 

I went into the first Elm DC meetup, of which I was the organizer, with zero knowledge of Elm. I knew it was a programming language designed with the functional reactive paradigm in mind, and that it inspired Redux, but that's it. We are using Angular (4) with RxJS and ngrx/store at work so I understood some of the concepts at a high level, but I couldn't have told you how to write a function in Elm. 

As it turned out, I was not the only one there lacking Elm experience. Of the five other folks who showed up, only one had even dipped their toe in the Elm waters. I was relieved. For the first couple of meetups, we mostly just talked about the history of functional programming for a couple of hours and everyone went home. Meetup adjourned.

As the months passed, I got used to scheduling the meetups, speaking to the group, giving lightning talks, arranging lightning talks, and generally getting the conversation going. 

At the most recent meetup, I had the idea to hook my Macbook up to the big TV in the conference room and work through a coding challenge in Elm on the premise that anyone interested could join in.

The first few minutes were a bit awkward, as a room full of programmers may be from time to time, but one at a time, people started looking up from their screens and chipping in an idea here, a comment there. Before I knew it, every single person in that room (there were about 7 of us) had rallied around the TV and was completely immersed in the challenge, some even standing up from their seats and moving closer to the screen.

In that moment, I realized that I found my people. I picked the right profession. A wave of relief hit me. Being new to this industry, the feeling of being a "noob" is one I'm quite familiar with. But in that room, experience and knowledge didn't matter. Despite our many different personalities and levels of experience, we were all cut from the same cloth -- we were programmers, problem solvers. Put a problem in front of us and we won't be able to stop our minds from going to work on that problem, even if we try. We gravitate towards unsolved problems and stare them in the face until they become solutions, then we go look for new problems to grapple with. That's what we do, it's who we are. 

As unique individuals, we combine this defining trait with other personality characteristics, mental strengths, and domain specific knowledge, but I posit that the spine of every programmer's mind is that urge to solve problems. It doesn't matter how early or late we are in our career, what technologies and tools we happen to use in the moment, what we studied in college, whether we are designing a system to mimic human brain with a machine or tracking down a TypeError -- the ability to identify problems and the drive to solve them powers everything we do and is the only reason we can do what we do. It's a beautiful thing and I'm proud to be in the club.
