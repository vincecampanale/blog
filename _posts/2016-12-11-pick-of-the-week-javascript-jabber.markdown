My first ever "Pick of the Week" has to be [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber), an awesome podcast hosted by Charles Max Wood. Charles hosts several podcasts and has contributed so much to the developer community.  His depth and breadth of knowledge is impressive and his ability to facilitate a conversation is one-of-a-kind. To me, he's an inspiration.

In fact, the whole idea of "Pick of the Week" comes from his shows. At the end of every show, the whole panel and guests briefly mentions a few "picks." Picks can include books, podcasts, games, articles, blogs, TV shows, movies, conferences -- anything and everything is fair game.  I love this idea because it allows everyone on the show to break out of "developer mode" for a moment and talk about something they love.

As a newcomer to the web development scene, I've learned so much from the JSJ podcasts. They help me learn to speak and think like a developer, while keeping me up to date on new trends in the Javascript world. He has some other great podcasts and I'll probably end up talking about those for future picks, but Javascript Jabber is the one that got me hooked on podcasts and remains my favorite podcast to this day.

 A couple of my favorite episodes on JavaScript Jabber: [Episode 219: Learning JavaScript in 2016](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/219-jsj-learning-javascript-in-2016) and [Episode 124: The Origin of Javascript with Brandon Eich](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/124-jsj-the-origin-of-javascript-with-brendan-eich).

 Check em out!
