This week's "Pick of the Week" is [Habitica](https://habitica.com).

I love RPGs, especially the online ones (Runescape, World of Warcraft). But I've always thought to myself: people (myself included) spend hours and hours developing and improving skills in these games in lieu of accomplishing stuff in real life. It's not even *fun* sometimes - like have you ever "fished" in Runescape? The little pixelated character just sits there and wiggles a fishing rod while you wait and click. In terms of being engaging and entertaining, real fishing beats Runescape fishing by a mile. So, what makes so many people choose Runescape fishing over real fishing?

There are definitely lots of answers to this question and a lot of them have to do with our "sedentary lifestyle" and "lack of appreciation for the outdoors" and lots of others things that fist-shaking old men could rattle off in their sleep, but I won't go there for now. I think a big one has to do with the sense of accomplishment. The effort involved in Runescape fishing is *so* minimal. With a slight movement in your index finger, you get a big "Congratulations!" box and actual *fireworks* go off. In real fishing, you get to stick your hand in a slimy fish mouth and try to remove the hook from a wet, angry, struggling fish.

So, what if there was a way to get this computer-engineered dopamine rush for accomplishing something in real life? Ironically, for those of us who grew up with video games, it might make developing real skills and accomplishing real goals feel a lot more *real*.

Habitica attempts to do just that. You make a character, load up your daily tasks, habits (good and bad), to-do's, goals, and anything else relevant to improving your life. Then, as you accomplish things you check them off and gain experience, gold, little "congratulations" boxes, the whole thing. If you get lazy and don't finish your tasks or slip up and fall back on a bad habit, your character loses health (which is symbolic for you hurting your future self by not getting your shit done and smoking that cigarette). There's a large, active community of people who start guilds and make challenges for people to take on. There is even a party system with bosses to fight and quests to do.

For me, it's really satisfying to spend an hour working on something like a personal project or practicing piano, then check it off on a todo list and get a reward and do some boss damage. Habitica actually motivates me to stay on task day-to-day and I've definitely noticed an improvement in my overall productivity. It also has an intuitive, easy-to-use interface for to-do lists and reminders, which makes it easy to plan a day and execute on that plan.

Last but not least, Habitica is completely open source! So if you want to contribute to the app or submit a new feature, you just go into their [repository on Github](https://github.com/HabitRPG/habitica), fork it, and start hacking. It's just a giant Angular app, so if you have any experience with Angular it's super easy to get going. There's even an issue label "type: entry level coding" for beginners. Really great project maintained by great people. If you like video games and being productive, I'd definitely recommend [checking it out](https://habitica.com).
