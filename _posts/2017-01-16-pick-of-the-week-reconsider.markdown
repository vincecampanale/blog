A few days ago, an article called [RECONSIDER](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857f#.2uqxrn3br){:target="_blank"} popped up on my twitter feed. It was written by David Heinemeier Hansson, the guy who created Ruby on Rails. He's also the Founder and CTO of a company called Basecamp (formerly 37signals) that has a sweet blog on Medium called [Signal v. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/){:target="_blank"}. In short, he's cool and worth listening to (everybody is worth listening to, but this guy especially is).

His main argument revolves around poo-pooing the notion that in order to be "successful" in tech, you have to be a disrupto-unicorn. I appreciate his hard-hitting candidness and admire the clarity with which he communicates. Some memorable quotes that really stuck with me:

>Part of the problem seems to be that nobody these days is content to merely put their dent in the universe. No, they have to fucking own the universe. It’s not enough to be in the market, they have to dominate it. It’s not enough to serve customers, they have to capture them.

>The web is the greatest entrepreneurial platform ever invented. Lowest barriers of entry, greatest human reach ever. I love the web. Permission-less, grand reach, diversity of implementation. Don’t believe this imaginary wall of access of money. It isn’t there.

As a young person working hard, dreaming to make a dent in the universe through the web, these are encouraging words. As someone who didn't go to Stanford to study computer science, isn't willing to relocate to San Francisco, isn't part of Y Combinator, and has never met an "Angel," the prospect of building a business on the web is intimidating. It's like there's this recipe for success and if you don't have the aforementioned ingredients, you should just get out of the kitchen. But the reality is this: there *is* no recipe. The real ingredients are accessible and few:  
1) A simple solution to a common problem.  
2) A computer and the ability to tell that computer what to do.  
3) Blood, sweat, and tears.  
Combine those things however you want and you can make a dent.

DHH & his co-founder/friend Jason Fried wrote a book called "Rework" together, which I ordered from Amazon a couple days ago and am tearing through. It's easy-to-read, funny, practical, and *wise*. Already planning to write about it as my pick of the week next week - stay tuned.

Hasta luego.
