Humans, much like machines, respond to specific information with a specific response. Whether the response represents a misunderstanding of the information (like an error) or a function of the information (like the fulfillment of a Promise), each and every human interaction is simply an exchange of information. The ways humans exchange information are manifold and the majority of them are subconscious. I do not claim to know what these subconscious exchanges are or how they work, however I am certain they exist. This essay discusses the primary, *conscious* channels humans use to communicate with one another. To understand the ubiquity and magnitude of these exchanges is to recognize the importance of the channels through which you transmit information.  

Most likely, the primary tool you use to pass information to other humans is the “word.” Whether spoken or written, words are powerful tools. They encapsulate meaning in little packages of mostly arbitrary characters that are associated with sounds (we call these “letters”). Words can be recorded, invented, jumbled, combined, and contextualized in countless ways. Every word I say to you is an agreement between you and I that *this* sound or *this* string of characters stands for *this* idea. Careful and intentional word choice really increases the likelihood of clear communication.  

Gestures are another simple, yet powerful way to convey meaning. For some, gestures adequately serve as an entire language.  Assuming two people share the same community / culture, a simple gesture can stand for an entire phrase or concept. Additionally, many gestures are universal. A grin, for example, can be understood by every member of the human race (and even some other species). In fact, many facial expressions are so powerful that their meaning can be understood without the pact of language. I think it’s fair to assume that words like “smile” and “frown” were at some point in their etymological tree simply “made up” by some dude.  Going one step further, I would argue that the fact that infants are capable of both sending and receiving information through gestures, these gestures convey massive meaning *without* words and therefore can be more meaningful than words. This point may seem obvious and somewhat frivolous at first, but consider the power that a warm hug can have at the right moment. There is no word or string of words that can have that effect.  

We have been familiar with language for so long that we take it for granted. Nearly all of us have been familiar with most gestures since the day we were born. Due to this familiarity, a lack of respect has settled in.  

Unfortunately, the power of these forms of communication can be abused and frequently are.  

No, my friend, some words are not “just words.” Some words inspire hatred, fear, disgust, and sadness. Some words are truly better left *unsaid*. It is important to be aware of these words and comprehend their meaning because depending on context and intention, a single slip-up can change someone’s life. The agreements with these words are typically strong within a culture at large and understood by a fairly young age. You know what these words are in your culture. To purposefully ignore the direness of these words is to purposefully ignore experiences and sentiments that have deep impacts. Much like computers, humans receiving the wrong word at the wrong time can lead to errors of misunderstanding that have major consequences.  

The same goes for some gestures.  

If you encounter another person with whom you share a large set of agreements (language, culture), recognize that you are extremely close to that person in time and space.  The context you two share is remarkable on the scale of human life. Your thread is sufficiently intertwined with their thread that an interaction has surfaced. Your actions (words, and gestures included) are merging with their actions. I implore you to treat this interaction with respect and *act wisely*.
