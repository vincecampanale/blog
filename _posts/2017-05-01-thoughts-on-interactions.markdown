Humans, much like machines, respond to specific information with a specific response. Whether the response represents a misunderstanding of the information (like an error) or a function of the information (like the fulfillment of a Promise), each and every human interaction is simply an exchange of information. The ways humans exchange information are manifold and the majority of them are subconscious. I do not claim to know what these subconscious exchanges are or how they work, however I am certain they exist. This essay discusses the primary, *conscious* channel humans use to communicate with one another: the "word". Exchanges via this channel are often taken for granted due to the ubiquity with which they are transmitted.

More often than not, the primary tool you use to pass information to other humans is the “word.” Whether spoken or written, words are powerful tools. They encapsulate meaning in little packages of mostly arbitrary characters that are associated with sounds (we call these “letters”). Words can be recorded, invented, jumbled, combined, and contextualized in countless ways. Every word I say to you is an agreement between you and I that *this* sound or *this* string of characters stands for *this* idea. Careful and intentional word choice really increases the likelihood of clear communication.  

<!-- Gestures are another simple, yet powerful way to convey meaning. For some, gestures adequately serve as an entire language.  Assuming two people share the same community / culture, a simple gesture can stand for an entire phrase or concept. Additionally, many gestures are universal. A grin, for example, can be understood by every member of the human race (and even some other species). Indeed, all facial expressions can be understood without the pact of language and certainly preceded language (I think it’s fair to assume that words like “smile” and “frown” were at some point in their etymological tree simply “made up” by some dude). Even infants are capable of both sending and receiving information through facial expressions. These and other gestures convey immense meaning *without* words. This point may seem obvious and somewhat frivolous at first, but consider the power that a warm hug can have at the right moment. There is no word or string of words that can have that effect.   -->

We have been familiar with this concept for so long that we take it for granted. This familiarity unfortunately makes room for abuse, even on a grand, societal scale.

<!-- When it comes to gestures, we have known them since the day we were born. Due to this familiarity, it is easy to forget the weight of these words and gestures.    -->


<!-- These forms of communication can be abused and frequently are -- especially words.   -->

Some words are not “just words.” Some words inspire hatred, fear, disgust, and sadness. Some words are truly better left *unsaid*. It is important to be aware of these words and comprehend their meaning because depending on context and intention, a single slip-up can change someone’s life. The agreements with these words are typically strong within a culture at large and understood by a fairly young age. You know what these words are in your culture.   <!-- To purposefully ignore the direness of these words is to purposefully ignore experiences and sentiments that have deep impacts. -->

Much like computers, humans receiving the wrong word at the wrong time can lead to errors of misunderstanding that have major consequences.  

<!-- The same goes for some gestures.   -->

Encountering another person with whom you share a large set of agreements (language, culture) is remarkable on the scale of human life. Your thread is sufficiently intertwined with their thread that an interaction has surfaced. Your actions (words, gestures) are merging with their actions. It is important to recognize the weight of these interactions and act with wisdom, no matter the interaction. When you take a moment to recognize the importance of a word before you say it, you give appreciation to the billions of years of evolution that went into that word. You sense its importance and feel the power of expression it provides you. This may feel unnatural at first. We use so many words so frequently. They *all* can't possibly mean *that* much, can they?  


Well, yes and no.

Even the filler words came from somewhere. For example, the word "like" is *everywhere* for a segment of humans on this planet.
