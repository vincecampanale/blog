Functional programming has been a hot topic as of late. I'm not going to cover much about FP in this article, but if you want to learn more (and you should), just type 'Eric Elliot functional programming' into The Almighty Google and start reading.

Map & filter are two crucial functions in functional programming. You don't have to know anything about functional programming to know how to use them and I guarantee you that these two little functions _will_ improve your code.

Let's learn by example. This exercise is taken straight from a tutorial I'm currently working through called "Functional Programming in Javascript," which is intended to serve as an introduction to RxJs (Reactive Extensions). Check it out when you're done reading this article: [http://reactivex.io/learnrx/](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/). I'm going to solve the same problem in a couple different ways to show the true beauty of `.map()` and `.filter()`.

Here we have some data containing a list of newly released movies in JSON format:

{% highlight javascript %}
//Excellent test data from http://reactivex.io/learnrx/
 var newReleases = [
     {
       "id": 70111470,
       "title": "Die Hard",
       "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/DieHard.jpg",
       "uri": "http://api.netflix.com/catalog/titles/movies/70111470",
       "rating": 4.0,
       "bookmark": []
     },
     {
       "id": 654356453,
       "title": "Bad Boys",
       "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/BadBoys.jpg",
       "uri": "http://api.netflix.com/catalog/titles/movies/70111470",
       "rating": 5.0,
       "bookmark": [{ id: 432534, time: 65876586 }]
     },
     {
       "id": 65432445,
       "title": "The Chamber",
       "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/TheChamber.jpg",
       "uri": "http://api.netflix.com/catalog/titles/movies/70111470",
       "rating": 4.0,
       "bookmark": []
     },
     {
       "id": 675465,
       "title": "Fracture",
       "boxart": "http://cdn-0.nflximg.com/images/2891/Fracture.jpg",
       "uri": "http://api.netflix.com/catalog/titles/movies/70111470",
       "rating": 5.0,
       "bookmark": [{ id: 432534, time: 65876586 }]
     }
   ];
{% endhighlight %}

Each movie has several properties: `id`, `title`, `boxart`, `uri`, `rating`, and `bookmark` (an array of JSON objects). In this tutorial, I'm going to solve a simple problem: _use map and filter to collect the ids of movies with 5.0 ratings_.

#### üíì For the Love of Loops üíì
The first way I will solve this problem makes use of our oldest friend, the humble `for` loop.

{% highlight javascript %}
var counter,
  otherCounter,
  favorites = [],
  favoriteIds = [];

for ( counter = 0; counter < newReleases.length; counter++ ) {
  if ( newReleases[counter].rating === 5.0 ) {
    favorites.push(newReleases[counter]);
  }
}

for ( otherCounter = 0; otherCounter < favorites.length; otherCounter++ ) {
  favoriteIds.push(favorites[otherCounter].id);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Lovely. This gets the job done, but I have three problems with this code:  

    1) There's a lot of code here to do a simple task.  

    2) We're making a lot of variables to track our values, which is pretty wasteful memory-wise.  

    3) Does it really matter that we traverse the movie list from the beginning to end? Couldn't we do it in any order? Do we really *need* to explicitly spell that out in our code?  

  Ask yourself number three and really sit and contemplate that for a moment. When we use the `for` loop to tell an iterator to traverse an array, we have to spell out in code the _order_ in which the array is traversed. This is useful sometimes, but most of the time we're just going from beginning to end -- smells like abstraction time.

#### For Each or Not For Each üìñ
`.forEach()` abstracts the explicit logic of the `for` loop away. We just call `.forEach()` on our `newReleases` array and trust that the computer will traverse the array. The computer can traverse the array beginning to end, end to beginning, middle out, upside-down, it really doesn't matter. The point is: _we don't have to tell the computer about how the array is traversed -- we just know we're going to do something on each element of the array_. That's where the **reducer function** comes in. The reducer function is our instruction to the computer about _what_ should happen when the iterator encounters each element in the array. For example, let's say we want to check if a movie has a rating of 5 starts and push it to an array if it does. Our function would look like this:

{% highlight javascript %}
function (movie) {
  if ( movie.rating === 5.0) {
    favorites.push(movie);
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

By passing this function as a reducer to `.forEach()`, we run it on every element in the array.

{% highlight javascript %}

var favorites = [],
    favoriteIds = [];

newReleases.forEach(function(movie) {
  if ( movie.rating === 5.0 ) {
    favorites.push(movie);
  }
});

favorites.forEach(function(movie) {
  favoriteIds.push(movie.id);
});
{% endhighlight %}

Unfortunately, a lot of the original problems I had with the first solution have not gone away.  

    1) Still a lot of code for such a simple task.

    2) Still using variables to hold values as we go along.

    3) We may have gotten rid of the explicit `for` loops, but I still see the word "for" in there. The extra code defining the order of traversal is gone, but we're still saying "for each element in this array, do something." I think the fact that we want to apply this function to each element should be *implied*.  


#### Introducing the üåüStarsüåü of the Show
Time to use `.map()` and `.filter()` to get the job done. Now that we understand exactly what needs to be done to solve this problem, it should be easy to reverse understand what `.map()` and `.filter()` do for us.

`.map()` and `.filter()` are just unique variations on the classic `.forEach()`. The nice thing about them is that they handle a specific case for us so we don't have to bother telling the computer anything about "for this element, do this". It just goes without saying that we want each element of the collection to be processed. `.filter()` is used when we want to \*_ahem_\* filter each element in the collection based on a certain condition, which we provide in our reducer function.
`.map()` is used when we want to change each element in the array in some way. We're "mapping" each element from one value to another (via a process defined in our reducer function).

The moment we've all been waiting for:

{% highlight javascript %}
var favorites = newReleases.filter(function(movie) {
  return movie.rating === 5.0;
});

var favoriteIds = favorites.map(function(movie) {
  return movie.id;
});
{% endhighlight %}

Hmmm... better...  

Still not best, though. Let's look at our original pain points and compare:

    1) I still think we could do this with less code.

    2) Still skeptical about the need for two variables to compute one value...

    3) ‚úîÔ∏è No more "for"! I'd say this problem is solved.  


Whew, abstracting away that `for` loop took some effort, but it's officially taken care of now. We're almost done, I promise.

#### FILTERüîóMAP
Method chaining is a wonderful thing.

{% highlight javascript %}
var favoriteIds = newReleases
  .filter(function(movie) {
    return movie.ration === 5.0;
  })
  .map(function(movie) {
    return movie.id;
  });
{% endhighlight %}

That takes care of number 2.

    1) Still a bit verbose. I think we could sweeten this up with some syntactic sugar.*

    2) ‚úîÔ∏è One value. One variable.

    3) ‚úîÔ∏è No more "for"!

\*_Note: Despite what some may believe, arrow functions in Javascript are much more than mere syntactic sugar. Article about this coming soon. Just wanted to use the 'sweeten' joke._

#### ARROWS ‚ÜóÔ∏è ‚¨ÖÔ∏è ‚¨ÜÔ∏è ‚û°Ô∏è ‚ÜòÔ∏è
Let's shorten this with some ES6 arrows.

{% highlight javascript %}
var favoriteIds = newReleases.
  filter( movie => { return movie. rating === 5.0 }).
  map( movie => { return movie.id });
{% endhighlight %}

#### `const`, Implicit Return & Abbreviated Variables [DANGER: Experts only.]
Proceed with caution. Someone call the fire department. üöí

{% highlight javascript %}
const favIds = newReleases.filter( m => m.rating === 5 ).map( m => m.id );
{% endhighlight %}

    1) ‚úîÔ∏è Short & sweet.

    2) ‚úîÔ∏è One value. One variable.

    3) ‚úîÔ∏è No more "for"!

That's all folks.
